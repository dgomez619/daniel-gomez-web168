                Web development is a career that has really interested me for a long time, I find fascinating the things that can be created by coding and then being able to see the final project metarialized in a browser as a website or even a mobile app. I think we live in a time where we intereact with applications and websites almost all day everyday, either for work, social life, or even for health reasons, almost any interaction we need to make with others can be canalized through an app, for example banking, it's not necesary to go to the banks in person anymore, many things can be done through an online banking app, like depositing a check, or a doctors appointment, it can now be through an online interface, created by a web/app developer that lets the patient and a health expert interconnect and discuss in real time without having to be in the same room face to face. My goal is to be able to create applications like these that would make the end user's life a bit easier and more practical.

                As I learn more and more about Web Development I can see that there are endless posibilities when it comes to creativity, I consider Web Design an art, yes some websites are simple, and maybe they are simple because they don't need to be too fancy, it all depends on the purpose of the website or application, but there are so many websites and applications that are truly a work of art, the designs are flawless and captivating, not only that they also work perfectly and efficiently, easy to navigate and very clear with the content.
